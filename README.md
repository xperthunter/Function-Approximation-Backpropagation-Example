# Function-Approximation-Backpropagation-Example
Example implementation of backpropagation in estimating functions using feedforward multi-layer neural networks.

## Goals
I am developing deep-learning tools for my thesis research, and wanted to develop a set of problems and projects that would help me learn the basics of artificial neural networks. Specifically, I wanted to study two aspects of Deep Learning I had read about: (1) network optimization through backpropagation, (2) universal function approximation.

## Approach
I went off of [Michael Nielsen's Deep Learning](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/) book and the code implemented in the tutorials. I wanted to implement the backpropagation algorithm on a multi-layer feedforward network for learning any function mapping a single input to single output, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\inline&space;\large&space;f(x)&space;=&space;y" title="\large f(x) = y" />.
